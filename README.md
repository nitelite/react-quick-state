# react-quick-state
An quick way to manage global state in React application. Compliant with functional components with hooks and traditional class components.

Heavily inspired by no-longer-maintained library [react-easy-state](https://github.com/RisingStack/react-easy-state), but hopefully with less monkey-patching and scheduler interference.
